**current_stop_sequence** | Option<**i32**> | Index of current stop along trip. See [GTFS-realtime VehiclePosition current_stop_sequence](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-vehicleposition) | [optional]
**current_status** | Option<**String**> | Status of vehicle relative to the stops. See [GTFS-realtime VehicleStopStatus](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-vehiclestopstatus).  | _**Value**_       | _**Description**_                                                                                          | |-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | **INCOMING_AT**   | The vehicle is just about to arrive at the stop (on a stop display, the vehicle symbol typically flashes). | | **STOPPED_AT**    | The vehicle is standing at the stop.                                                                       | | **IN_TRANSIT_TO** | The vehicle has departed the previous stop and is in transit.                                              |   | [optional]
**carriages** | Option<[**Vec<crate::models::VehicleResourceAttributesCarriagesInner>**](VehicleResource_attributes_carriages_inner.md)> | Carriage-level crowding details. See [GTFS-realtime multi_carriage_details](https://gtfs.org/realtime/reference/#message-CarriageDetails).  | [optional]
**bearing** | Option<**i32**> | Bearing, in degrees, clockwise from True North, i.e., 0 is North and 90 is East. This can be the compass bearing, or the direction towards the next stop or intermediate location.
